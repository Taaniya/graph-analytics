This repository contains work on graphs for Machine learning
and codes for the following Medium article :

[Applications of Graph Laplacian in Machine learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-laplacian-and-its-application-in-machine-learning-7d9aab021d16)

The notebook [Spectral_clustering_custom_vs_library_code](./Spectral_clustering_custom_vs_library_code.ipynb) explains the implementation of custom implementation of spectral clustering algorithm and compares its performance with scikit-learn's implementation.
